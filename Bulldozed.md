## America Inc is in for a rough earnings season

> The Economist Jan. 28th 2023 edition Business

Chief executives of the world’s biggest firms seem in highish spirits ==of late== **(最近)**. Although they see the war in Ukraine as a humanitarian **(人道主义)** tragedy **(悲剧)**, the risks to the world economy look for now to be contained **(控制)**. Central banks have ==got serious about== **(严肃对待)** inflation **(膨胀)**. The world economy has held up better than expected a few months ago. Globalisation may not be in ==the rudest of health== **(非常健康)**, but news of its demise **终止/失败** appears, to many bosses, exaggerated **(夸大的)**.

The mood in ==corner offices== **(指领导的办公室)** may be about to sour **(变坏/不愉快)**. “Earnings season is going to be the confessional **(坦白)** event,” says Jim Tierney of Bernstein, an investment firm, referring to the month or so when most companies report their quarterly results. The profits of America’s banking giants, which kicked things off earlier this month, fell by 20% year on year. Investment bankers got a particularly severe drubbing, as **(因为)** dealmaking collapsed amid economic uncertainty. Goldman Sachs is giving around 3,200 of its workers the boot.By January 25th titans of other industries, from manufacturing (3m and Boeing) to consumer goods (Kimberly-Clark) and technology (Microsoft), had reported soggy **(沉闷的)** earnings. Profit estimates for large American firms are plunging **(暴跌)**.

The first thing to which firms will be confessing **(忏悔)** is the weariness **(疲倦)** of consumers. In firms’ conference calls with analysts at the end of last year, many spoke of weak demand, **as** shoppers ==reined in== **(严格控制)** spending on ==discretionary items==. Procter & Gamble, whose products range from nappies **(尿布)** and detergents **(洗衣粉)** to dental floss **(牙线)**, has reported falling sales volumes across its businesses in the fourth quarter. It managed to meet earnings expectations only because it increased prices by 10% and plans further rises in February.

Yet ==the chorus of bosses== advertising such “pricing power”, last year’s favourite boast **(吹牛)**, will be quieter this earnings season. Although households are still spending excess savings built up during the pandemic, they are increasingly fishing for bargains **(便宜货)**.

As demand falters, firms are owning up to excessive costs—their second confession. Technology companies, which saw demand for their products slow last year from pandemic-induced highs, are doing so with special zeal. Apple’s boss, Tim Cook, is taking a 40% pay cut this year. Less symbolically, on January 18th Microsoft announced that it would lay off 10,000 people. Two days later Alphabet, Google’s corporate parent, said it would sack 12,000. These cuts do not entirely reverse big tech’s pandemic hiring binge, but a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist thinks it will provide “air cover” for more tech firms to trim their payrolls and shore up their cashflows.

Companies’ third confession concerns the fate of any profits that will be made. This earnings season is also a time for firms to lay out their spending plans for the year ahead. In aggregate **(总计)**, large American businesses tend to split their outgoings evenly between shareholder payouts (through dividends and share buy-backs) and investments (research and development, capital expenditure, and mergers and acquisitions).

In the era of cheap money, before central banks started raising interest rates to quash inflation, the payouts were often financed with debt. Now that money is getting expensive, such borrowing is likely to subside. As for dealmaking, plenty of acquirers are still sorting out the mess created by transactions struck at peak prices during the pandemic merger boom.

That leaves investments. The 21st century’s mega-trends—decarbonisation, digitisation and decoupling between China and the West—argue in favour of mammoth spending on climate-friendly technology, on robots and software, and on non-Chinese factories. One European industrial boss contends that, as a result, capital spending should withstand the impending downturn better than usual.

Like all earnings seasons, this one will spring positive surprises. A few have already sprung. United Airlines increased its prices without putting off passengers. Netflix smashed expectations by adding 7.7m new subscribers in the fourth quarter, partly thanks to a new, cheaper, ad-interrupted service.On January 25th Tesla reported a record quarterly profit.

Such perkiness will, however, be the exception rather than the rule this year. In aggregate, positive earnings surprises have been getting less positive in recent quarters. High debt and low taxes, which propelled corporate profitability for several decades, are no longer the tailwinds they were, as interest rates rise and the appetite for deficit-funded tax cuts diminishes. As this new reality sinks in, ceos’ half-full glasses may suddenly look half-empty.
